# awp

This repo contain a collection from pixel art gif landscapes that I manipulated to fit some particular purposes.

## I use this way to get animated wallpaper (without transparency, xcompmgr doesn't handle that.)

```DISPLAY=:0 gifview +e --animate -U -w root ~/.config/*.gif &```

## notice

I didn't draw any of these, if that arrives; You'll be warned about. I just did my best to scale them for the purpose.
